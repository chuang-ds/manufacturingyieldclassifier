# Binary Classifier for Manufacturing Yield

This notebook explores the secom dataset hosted by UC Irvine's machine learning repository. This publicly available dataset was donated in 2008 by Michael McCann and Adrian Johnston. The dataset is a collection of signals/variables collected from sensors in a modern manufacturing line.

This notebook will import the manufacturing data, perform exploratory analysis, clean and prepare the data, build predictive binary classifier models that predict yield loss (yes/no) from sensor readings. Finally, the notebook will compare results from various models and make recommendations on how best to leverage sensor data to reduce mean time to detect yield loss.
